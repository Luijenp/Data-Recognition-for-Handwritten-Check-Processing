# Data-Recognition-for-Handwritten-Check-Processing
This project tackles the challenge of accurately recognizing and converting handwritten digits from checks, bank statements, and account balances. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the proposed solution aims to enhance check processing efficiency for financial institutions, minimizing manual effort and reducing the likelihood of human error. The methodology centers on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework, trained and validated using the MNIST dataset and custom synthetic data, ensuring robust performance across diverse handwritten digit styles.
